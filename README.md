Researching non-obvious misuse paths caused by implicit trust and “working as intended” behavior.
 Implicit Trust Boundaries

This repository explores security-relevant misuse paths that arise from
implicit defaults and expected behavior rather than explicit vulnerabilities.

 Scope
- Trust boundary analysis
- Assumption-driven risk
- By-design abuse cases
- Defensive threat modeling

 Philosophy
Many failures occur not because systems are broken,
but because they behave exactly as designed.

Discussion-driven, research-focused.
